Our house has always had water and drainage problems.  The previous owner had buried black corrugated pipe from the downspouts to route water to large concrete drains.  They were horrible clogged with leaves and grit from the shingles.  In 2007 Chris pulled out the corrugated pipe and started replacing it with 4 inch PVC.

By 2009, downspouts on both sides of the porch and next to the carport had been handled.  But the lone downspout on the southwest corner of the house was going to an above ground corrugated pipe.  Earlier in 2015 Chris finished the trench to the property line, cutting the phone line in the process.  He also started the trench to handle the last downspout.

Today another 10 foot PVC pipe is all the remains to getting the water off of the property.  Another 10 foot piece and a few elbows may be used to allow future rain water collection.  Work was completed just in time for an August thunderstorm to baptize the new pipe.  No leaks.
