The push mower is acting up again.
The jet for the carb is probably plugged again.

Liz has suggested that it's time for a riding lawn mower.
Price wise the MTD Cub Cadets look like a better deal than the John Deers.
Home Depot and Tractor Supply carry them.  Tractor Supply will even have
belts for the older ones.
There are a few authorized dealers in the area as well.

Some trips to look at the relative PITA for maintenance are in order.
